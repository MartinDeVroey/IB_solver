# IB_solver
This is a tool for solving the Information Bottleneck problem [(Tishby, Pereira, Bialek 1999)](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/labs/learning/Papers/allerton.pdf).
It implements the algorithm presented in [(Strouse & Schwab 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00268) for soving "the original information bottleneck".

Features X must be indicies of a 2D array and labels Y must be binary.\
The main function is in IB.py and IB_test.ipynb contains an examle of how the IB function can be used.
